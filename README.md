Interface between [libfranka] and [mc_rtc]. It provides multi-robot support and connect [mc_panda] devices to their [libfranka] counterpart.

Dependencies
------------

This package requires:
- [mc_panda]

You will also need the `linux-libc-dev` package on Ubuntu and Debian systems.

Usage
--

1. Make sure the system is [setup properly to work with the robot](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/getting_started.html#verifying-the-connection)
2. Install this project's dependencies
3. Install this project (`cmake`/`make`/`make install`)
4. Make sure your user account has sufficient memory limits

For that last point, you want to edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` and add the following line:

```
USERNAME - memlock 1000000000
```

Then log-out and log-in, you can confirm the new limit is active by running:

```bash
ulimit -l
```

Your mc_rtc configuration file (typically `~/.config/mc_rtc/mc_rtc.yaml`) should contain the following lines:

```yaml
# General mc_rtc configuration to run a panda controller at 1kHz
MainRobot: PandaDefault # Or PandaHand/PandaFoot/PandaPump according to the end-effector installed on the robot
Enabled: YourController
Timestep: 0.001

# Set a LogPolicy suitable for real-time
LogPolicy: threaded

# Franka specific configuration
Franka:
  ControlMode: Position # Can be: Position/Velocity/Torque
  panda_default: # Name of the robot in the controller
    ip: 172.16.0.2 # IP of the robot
  panda_2: # Name of an extra panda in the controller
    ip: 172.16.1.2
  # Actuated robots that are not controlled via mc_franka
  ignored: [env/door, env/box]
```

Run the program:

```bash
MCFrankaControl
```

You can also provide an additional configuration file (to swap between different network configurations easily for example):

```bash
MCFrankaControl -f conf.yaml
```

Known issues
--

- `MCFrankaControl` will not pick up on newly installed libraries. To work-around this issue, run the following command after installing a new module:

```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

- `MCFrankaControl` will not pick up ROS libraries. If you're using `mc_rtc`'s ROS plugin, create a file `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/ros.conf` with content:

```
/opt/ros/noetic/lib
```

It seems that this change will only be picked up after reboot.
